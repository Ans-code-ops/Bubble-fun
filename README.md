# Bubble-Game
 A simple and interactive bubble popping game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to pop as many bubbles as you can within a given time limit. The game offers a fun and engaging experience where bubbles randomly appear and float around the screen, and the player must click on them to pop them. Each bubble popped earns the player points, and the game ends when the timer runs out.
